All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Don't worry what people say, we know the truth
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Enough is enough of this garbage
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Skin head, dead head
Everybody gone bad
Situation aggravation
Everybody, allegation
In the suite on the news
Everybody, dog food
Bang-bang, shock dead
Everybody's gone mad
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
Beat me, hate me
You can never break me
Will me, thrill me
You can never kill me
Jew me, sue me
Everybody, do me
Kick me, kike me
Don't you black or white me
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is…
